I went through a double major in college and find myself at the leading edge when it comes to how fast my brain thinks... (at times). 
However, due to joining the project around 3 years ago, the site had already been commissioned and was up and running for 4 years.
There was abunch of intimate knowledge I missed out on learning and adding to my understanding. 
My boss is a physics major and doesn't have any issue with math and writing huge PL SQL queries. He is very smart. 
I am lacking some one to walk me through the methodology that was used from a source code standpoint, 
as we we do not have access to the source code in a sandbox environment it is very off putting to not want to upset an already extremly 
tense situation with the customer.
I would have to guess that we are providing SAAS (software as a service).
I did not get a chance to learn distributed systems.
Long story short...
I have been tasked to do something that I am not exactly sure on how to execute finding the bug in the source code if all I have is PL SQL
